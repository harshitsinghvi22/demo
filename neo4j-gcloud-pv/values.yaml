# gcePersistentDisk should the name of a Google Cloud Compute Persistent disk that is in a Region/Zone accessible by your GKE cluster.
# This persistent disk must already exist and not be in use

# A disk can be created using the gcloud cli:
# gcloud compute disks create --size 100Gi --type pd-ssd --zone="${CLOUDSDK_COMPUTE_ZONE}" "${GCE_PERSISTENT_DISK_NAME}"
# n.b. in Google Cloud disk IOPS are proportional to disk size. For good performance of Neo4j you may need to specify a disk size significantly larger than the
# amount of storage that Neo4j requires.
# We recommend a disk size of at least 1Ti for performance or load testing and at least 100Gi for development work.
